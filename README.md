# RCS_Node_Poll

RCS Node Poll

This program scans the Mystic BBS log files, and determines the last connection with each node identified in the rcs.ini file. This is a very handy tool for those sysops running a hub. The report shows each of the node numbers, and indicates the last connection either from the mis.log files or the fidopoll.log files.

If you use the log backup utility within the Mystic Multi Tools, this program will scan back through those backups to find the last connection with each node.
